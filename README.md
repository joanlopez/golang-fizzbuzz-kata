# golang-fizzbuzz-kata
FizzBuzz Kata done with @erusso87, @cib009 and @jarstan in a training @ Atr√°palo.
It was a great experience that we enjoyed a lot :D

## Rules
We started with the rules [here](agilekatas.co.uk/katas/FizzBuzz-Kata) then we added some custom rules (spaces between words, ranges, sorting...)

## Objectives
- Learn how to avoid infinite switch cases or if..else cases and work with something similar to rule machines.
- Learn Golang.
