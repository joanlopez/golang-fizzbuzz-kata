# golang-fizzbuzz-kata
FizzBuzz Kata done with [@erusso87](https://github.com/erusso87), [@cib009](https://github.com/cib009) and [@jarstan](https://github.com/jarstan) in a training @ Atr√°palo.

It was a great experience that we enjoyed a lot :D

## Rules
We started with the rules [here](agilekatas.co.uk/katas/FizzBuzz-Kata) then we added some custom rules (spaces between words, ranges, sorting...)

## Objectives
- Learn how to avoid infinite switch cases or if..else cases and work with something similar to rule machines.
- Learn Golang.
